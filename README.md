# Predictor Modification Details

In the `predictor.py` file, significant modifications have been made, primarily in the `save_txt` and `save_frame` functions. Below are the specific changes:

## save_txt

- Adjustments have been made to the `save_txt` function to comply with the DarkLabel format requirements.
- Text files are named based on the frame number of the source video, using an eight-digit format for easier processing in DarkLabel.

## save_frame

- The `save_frame` function has been modified to support outputting both images and labels simultaneously when detecting real-time streaming video.
- Some code has been modified to ensure that the output filenames start with eight-digit sequential numbers for ease of processing.

These modifications make `predictor.py` more suitable for performing person detection using a pre-trained YOLO model and adjusting the output according to DarkLabel requirements.

## Notes

- Ensure that the YOLO pre-trained model and DarkLabel are properly configured before using the `save_txt` and `save_frame` functions.
- When saving label files, ensure that the correct naming format is used for further processing.

## Example Usage

```python
# Perform person detection using a pre-trained YOLO model and save label files and images
predictor.save_txt(source_video, output_dir)
predictor.save_frame(source_video, output_dir)
